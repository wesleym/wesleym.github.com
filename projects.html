<h1>Notable projects</h1>

<h2>Citrix Synchronizer for XenClient</h2>
2008

<p>Synchronizer is a virtual appliance used in administering a deployment of XenClient. Its front end is a web app written in Google Web Toolkit with Ext GWT. Rather than using a servlet back end, it uses CherryPy on Apache and communicates with the UI via JSON.</p>

<p>The development of Synchronizer involved meetings with product design and user experience teams as well as with other engineers to design the specifications of the product.</p>

<h2>Imager Lab redesign</h2>
Fall 2008

<p>The Imager Laboratory is an encompassing term for the various labs and disciplines at UBC. Its website was (and still is) a simple, static website. However, its layout and navigation are neither uniform nor satisfactorily easy to understand. Proposals for redesign were created in a team of three for an introductory human-computer interaction course (CPSC 344 UBC, Karon MacLean).</p>

<p>The redesign process involved knowledge-gathering from a multitude of stakeholders and a design process where prototypes are created of escalating fidelity, each evaluated by its stakeholders. The redesign is notable for its multitude of constraints and a handful of stakeholder disagreements. Only final recommendations and prototypes were produced; final product design was outside the course scope.</p>

<h2>JForum (prototype title)</h2>
Fall 2008

<p>JForum is an implementation of a basic web forum in Java Servlets/JSP. It was developed in a team of four as the final project for an advanced software engineering course (CPSC 410 UBC).</p>

<p>JForum is a basic forum with simple features, such as sections, topic threads, moderation, user authentication, and user profiles. JForum became an exercise in Java Servlet/JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while simultaneously challenging the team to write best-practice code that handles requests in a straightforward MVC manner.</p>

<p>JForum was developed under the waterfall model</p>

<h2>RareShare</h2>
Fall 2008

<p>RareShare is a system designed to augment existing BitTorrent techniques in cases when sources for a piece of a file are scarce or missing. RareShare uses the Parity Volume Set format popularized for use with Usenet binary newsgroups. It was developed in a team of three as the term project for a distributed systems course (CPSC 416 UBC).</p>

<p>A sharing technique is designed such that each peer need only download any set of pieces whose size totals that of the original set of files to recover those original files. Best of all, this technique is backwards-compatible with conventional BitTorrent protocols.</p>
