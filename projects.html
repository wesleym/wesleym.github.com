<h2>Citrix Synchronizer for XenClient</h2>
2008

<p>Synchronizer is a virtual appliance used in administering a deployment of XenClient. Its front end is a web app written in Google Web Toolkit with Ext GWT. Rather than using a servlet back end, it uses CherryPy on Apache and communicates with the UI via JSON.</p>

<p>The development of Synchronizer involved meetings with product design and user experience teams as well as with other engineers to design the specifications of the product.</p>

<h2>Imager Lab redesign</h2>
Fall 2008

<p>The Imager Laboratory is an encompassing term for the various labs and disciplines at UBC. Its website was (and still is) a simple, static website. However, its layout and navigation are neither uniform nor satisfactorily easy to understand. Proposals for redesign were created in a team of three for an introductory human-computer interaction course (CPSC 344 UBC, Karon MacLean).</p>

<p>The redesign process involved knowledge-gathering from a multitude of stakeholders and a design process where prototypes are created of escalating fidelity, each evaluated by its stakeholders. The redesign is notable for its multitude of constraints and a handful of stakeholder disagreements. Only final recommendations and prototypes were produced; final product design was outside the course scope.</p>
