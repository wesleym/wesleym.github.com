GWT structures web apps by allowing developers to express logic in the Java language and using Java metaphors like classes, interfaces, and packages, while providing a clean, type-safe interface to the target web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Sencha GXT 3 was a major rewrite of Sencha GXT to bring GXT back in line with the best practices introduced in GWT 2.</p>

<!-- Work - Citrix -->
<h3>Citrix Systems, Inc.</h3>

<p>2009–2011</p>

<p class=title>Lead User Interface Engineer, <a href="http://www.citrix.com/English/ps2/products/product.asp?contentID=2300325">Synchronizer for XenClient</a></p>

<p>Synchronizer is the administrative management interface to XenClient. Synchronizer handles deployments, upgrades, and assignments of desktop VM images. It's also the interface for registering devices and handling device loss.

<p>While at this place of work, I had a number of roles than changed subtly as time went on. I was the sole UI Engineer doing basic visual and interaction design and small amounts of server implementation. Later, I was the lead UI engineer, working with a User Experience team remotely and another User Interface Engineer locally.

<p>As UI engineer working on Synchronizer for XenClient, the position included development spanning several tiers of the application. These tiers included presentation (HTML, CSS), UI logic (Google Web Toolkit), and back end (CherryPy, Apache, SQLAlchemy).

<h4>Technologies used</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ext GWT 2 (now named Sencha GXT 2)</li>
<li>Google Web Toolkit</li>
<li>CherryPy</li>
<li>SQLAlchemy</li>
<li>Adobe Flex</li>
<li>Flare visualization library for Adobe Flex</li>

<h3>JIRA Integrations for IRC</h3>

<p>This IRC bot watches conversation go by in channel and expands JIRA tickets for configured projects when they are mentioned.</p>

<p>This bot was written in Python. It uses suds to access resources from the JIRA SOAP API.</p>

<!-- Code - Hipcommit -->

<h3>JIRA HipChat bot</h3>

<p>This IRC bot polls JIRA Studio, later Atlassian OnDemand, for changes in issue status and for the status of automated builds.</p>

<p>This bot was written in Python. It originally used urllib2, then later requests, both to request resources from the JIRA REST API and to send messages using the HipChat API.</p>

<!-- Code - JForum -->
<div class=col-md-5>
<h3>JForum</h3>

<p>JForum is an implementation of a basic web forum in Java Servlets/JSP. We developed it in a four-person team as the final project for Advanced Software Engineering (CPSC 410 UBC) for the fall 2008 term.</p>

<p>The system uses MySQL (no ORM), a Java backend (Servlets, JSP, JDBC), and HTML/CSS/JQuery on the frontend.</p>

<p>JForum is a basic forum with simple features, such as sections, topic threads, moderation, user authentication, and user profiles. JForum became an exercise in Java Servlet/JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while simultaneously challenging the team to write best-practice code that handles requests in a straightforward MVC manner.</p>

<p>We developed under the waterfall model, including writing of specifications and user testing (grading).</p>

<!-- Code - Rareshare -->
<div class=col-md-5>
<h3>Rareshare</h3>

<p>This is a BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer filesharing system that is more robust to cases where sources for a piece of a file are scarce or missing. We use the Parity Volume Set format – popularised in Usenet binary newsgroups – to generate check segments that can act as wildcards. These can correct for any missing segment of that size that is no longer available from any peer on the network. Once a full set of source files is obtained, any check segments not downloaded can be generated locally. Best of all, this system could be overlaid over existing protocols, such as BitTorrent.</p>

<p>I worked on a team of three students to develop Rareshare as the Distributed Systems (CPSC 416) term project for fall 2008.</p>
