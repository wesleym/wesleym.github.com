<h3>JIRA HipChat bot</h3>
<p>This IRC bot polls JIRA Studio, later Atlassian OnDemand, for changes in issue status and for the status of automated builds.</p>

<h3>JForum</h3>
<p>This is a basic forum system written as the term project for the Advanced Software Engineering course at UBC.</p>

<h3>Rareshare</h3>
<p>This is a BitTorrent-like system written as the term project for a Computer Networking course at UBC. The system distributes a file across a peer-to-peer network, but uses Reed-Solomon coding to generate check segments that can act as wildcard segments, able to correct for any given segment of that size that is no longer available from any peer on the network.</p>
