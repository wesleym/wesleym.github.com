<!-- Work - Citrix -->
<div class=span5>
<h3>Citrix Systems, Inc.</h3>

<p>2008–2011</p>

<p class=title>Lead User Interface Engineer, <a href="http://www.citrix.com/English/ps2/products/product.asp?contentID=2300325">Synchronizer for XenClient</a></p>

<p>Synchronizer is the administrative management interface to XenClient. Synchronizer handles deployments, upgrades, and assignments of desktop VM images. It's also the interface for registering devices and handling device loss.

<p>While at this place of work, I had a number of roles than changed subtly as time went on. I was the sole UI Engineer doing basic visual and interaction design and small amounts of server implementation. Later, I was the lead UI engineer, working with a User Experience team remotely and another User Interface Engineer locally.

<p>As UI engineer working on Synchronizer for XenClient, the position included development spanning several tiers of the application. These tiers included presentation (HTML, CSS), UI logic (Google Web Toolkit), and back end (CherryPy, Apache, SQLAlchemy).

<h3>JIRA Integrations for IRC</h3>

<p>This bot was written in Python. It uses suds to access resources from the JIRA SOAP API.</p>

<h3>JIRA HipChat bot</h3>

<p>This IRC bot polls JIRA Studio, later Atlassian OnDemand, for changes in issue status and for the status of automated builds.</p>

<p>This bot was written in Python. It originally used urllib2, then later requests, both to request resources from the JIRA REST API and to send messages using the HipChat API.</p>

<!-- Code - JForum -->
<div class=span5>
<h3>JForum</h3>

<p>JForum is an implementation of a basic web forum in Java Servlets/JSP. We developed it in a four-person team as the final project for Advanced Software Engineering (CPSC 410 UBC) for the fall 2008 term.</p>

<p>The system uses MySQL (no ORM), a Java backend (Servlets, JSP, JDBC), and HTML/CSS/JQuery on the frontend.</p>

<p>JForum is a basic forum with simple features, such as sections, topic threads, moderation, user authentication, and user profiles. JForum became an exercise in Java Servlet/JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while simultaneously challenging the team to write best-practice code that handles requests in a straightforward MVC manner.</p>

<p>We developed under the waterfall model, including writing of specifications and user testing (grading).</p>

<!-- Code - Rareshare -->
<div class=span5>
<h3>Rareshare</h3>
<p>This is a BitTorrent-like system written as the term project for a Computer Networking course at UBC. The system distributes a file across a peer-to-peer network, but uses Reed-Solomon coding to generate check segments that can act as wildcard segments, able to correct for any given segment of that size that is no longer available from any peer on the network.</p>

<hr>

<p>Fall 2008</p>

<p>RareShare is a system designed to augment existing BitTorrent techniques in cases when sources for a piece of a file are scarce or missing. RareShare uses the Parity Volume Set format popularized for use with Usenet binary newsgroups. It was developed in a team of three as the term project for a distributed systems course (CPSC 416 UBC).</p>

<p>A sharing technique is designed such that each peer need only download any set of pieces whose size totals that of the original set of files to recover those original files. Best of all, this technique is backwards-compatible with conventional BitTorrent protocols.</p>
