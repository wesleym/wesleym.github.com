<!-- Code - Conapp -->
<div class=col-md-10>
<h3>Conapp</h3>

<p><i>Currently undergoing maintenance</i>

<p>Conapp helps people at conferences find each other. In indoor venues and in close quarters, traditional checkin and geolocation apps don't represent fine enough detail for team members to find each other.

<p>By letting users enter their location as free text, updates can be much more descriptive and can include locations not officially part of the venue. For example, a user can update their location as “Panel Room B”, “Hilton Lobby”, or even “Chipotle on 4th”.

<p>Conapp is composed of a Go-based server backed by PostgreSQL, and frontends on web, iOS, and Android. iOS and Android users receive push notifications about location updates. (The backend also supports SMS through Twilio, but this option has been retired.)

<p>This resume is built on Bootstrap 3 and is available on GitHub.

<!-- Code - Talking Stick -->
<div class=col-md-5>
<h3>Talking Stick</h3>

<p>Talking stick is a Go App Engine app developed as a 20% project to facilitate the polite sharing of resources at Google. There are often shared test instances of apps like the Developer Console. By using Talking Stick, an engineer can claim this instance for exclusive use for a configurable amount of time. This triggers notifications via an internal chat system and email.
</div>

<!-- Code - Jirabot -->
<div class=col-md-5>
<h3>JIRA Integrations for IRC</h3>

<p>This IRC bot watches conversation go by in channel and expands JIRA tickets for configured projects when they are mentioned.

<p>This bot was written in Python. It uses suds to access resources from the JIRA SOAP API.
</div>

<!-- Code - Hipcommit -->
<div class=col-md-5>
<h3>JIRA HipChat bot</h3>

<p>This IRC bot polls JIRA Studio, later Atlassian OnDemand, for changes in issue status and for the status of automated builds.

<p>This bot was written in Python. It originally used urllib2, then later requests, both to request resources from the JIRA REST API and to send messages using the HipChat API.
</div>

<!-- Code - JForum -->
<div class=col-md-5>
<h3>JForum</h3>

<p>JForum is an implementation of a basic web forum in Java Servlets/JSP. We developed it in a four-person team as the final project for Advanced Software Engineering (CPSC 410 UBC) for the fall 2008 term.

<p>The system uses MySQL, Java EE (Servlets, JSP, JDBC), and HTML, CSS, and JQuery on the frontend.

<p>JForum is a basic forum with simple features, such as sections, topic threads, moderation, user authentication, and user profiles. JForum became an exercise in Java Servlet/JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while simultaneously challenging the team to write best-practice code that handles requests in a straightforward MVC manner.

<p>We developed under the waterfall model, including writing of specifications and user testing (grading).
</div>

<!-- Code - Rareshare -->
<div class=col-md-5>
<h3>Rareshare</h3>

<p>This is a BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer filesharing system that is more robust to cases where sources for a piece of a file are scarce or missing. We use the Parity Volume Set format – popularised in Usenet binary newsgroups – to generate check segments that can act as wildcards. These can correct for any missing segment of that size that is no longer available from any peer on the network. Once a full set of source files is obtained, any check segments not downloaded can be generated locally. Best of all, this system could be overlaid over existing protocols, such as BitTorrent.</p>

<p>I worked on a team of three students to develop Rareshare as the Distributed Systems (CPSC 416) term project for fall 2008.</p>
